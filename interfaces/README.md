This folder is no real sourcecode, and does not (yet) contain anything useful.
The type definitions are more a scratchpad, containing ideas of how to design
the APIs. In future this will change, as each module should get a real type-
definition with documentation about the behaviour and such. But up till now
this folder contains only notes, nothing serious.

You can check them out, they might help, but keep the work-in-progress stuff
in mind.
